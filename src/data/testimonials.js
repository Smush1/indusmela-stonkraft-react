      "testimonialMore": `read my review. I got this chess set yesterday and it is very nice, the size is genuinely too big which is the best part but there is only one defect that one of my white rook's red cloth is a little damaged and there were atleast 4-5 more pieces with unaligned red cloth but I fixed it still the white rook's red cloth is unfixable leaving that aside the chess is really nice it help me to analyse my game easily and the foldable chess board is awesome as it can be easily carried anywhere, it comes with a black carrying pouch in which we can keep our pieces, colour Is good overall.`,

      "testimonial": ` Compact and Stylish Roll-Up Chess Set for Travel. This roll-up chess board is perfect`,
      "testimonialMore": ` for bringing a good-quality game on the go. The pieces have a great look and feel, though they’re about half an inch smaller than standard tournament size, which works well for a travel set. The roll-up board is lightweight and easy to carry, making it ideal for family gatherings or casual play anywhere. Despite its portability, the set still provides a satisfying and functional game experience. The board lies flat when unrolled, and the pieces fit nicely on the squares. It’s the perfect combination of convenience and quality for chess lovers on the move. I’m happy to have a portable option that doesn’t compromise the playing experience!`,

      "testimonial": `Great Quality. I was a bit warey as there weren't many reviews for this product. But`,
      "testimonialMore": `for the price I thought it was worth the punt. We managed to pick up a marble chess board at our local Antique shop and we needed chess pieces to complement and complete the set! Wasn't keen on getting wooden and there aren't many options for marble ones in a reasonable price bracket!
These were delivered promptly and well packaged in foam which will come in handy to store the pieces when not in use.
Pieces are very well made and got a nice weight to them. My board is 10" x 10" so look really good together.
My only criticism is the felt on the bottom look like an after thought. I may change those later for something a little better. But overall I can't complain especially at this price point.`,
